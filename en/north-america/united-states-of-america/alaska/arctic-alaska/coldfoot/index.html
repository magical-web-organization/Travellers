		<h2 id="introduction-to-coldfoot">Introduction to Coldfoot</h2>

<p>Coldfoot is a remote Alaskan town located on the Dalton Highway in the Brooks Range, just north of the Arctic Circle.

Today, visitors come to Coldfoot to experience the rugged beauty of the Arctic wilderness, as well as to learn about the region’s history and cultural significance.</p>
